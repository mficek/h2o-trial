1. Use the dataset (`creditcard.csv`)
2. Split the above into train, validation, and test
3. Implement your own Logistic Regression (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) estimator from scratch using arbitrary estimation method:
	a. Avoid using 3rd party libraries like Scikit-learn and similar, which already contain this type of Model
	b. Avoid using 3rd party libraries which implement e.g. gradient descent, for optimizing the model
	c. You can use Numpy and similar, to operate on matrices.
4. Train the logistic regression model you built to predict the probability of default. The variables name is `DEFAULT_PAYMENT_NEXT_MONTH`. There is a dictionary that explains all the features included in the dataset called `dictionary.txt`.
5. Produce a report that summarizes your findings. Things to include in the report:
	a. Describe the features and the target included in the dataset. What insight did you gain from working with the data?
	b. Explain how you transformed the features, if at all
	c. How did your model do on the validation set? Test set?
	d. What were the most important features?
6. This is not meant to be an exercise to develop a 'final solution' but more a first pass, to understand how you would approach this kind of exercise.
7. Submit the report and any source code (these may be part of the same document if you are working with a Jupyter notebook, etc.).
