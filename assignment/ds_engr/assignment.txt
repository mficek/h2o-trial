1. Use the dataset (`creditcard.csv`)
2. Implement your own Logistic Regression (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) estimator from scratch using arbitrary estimation method:
	a. Avoid using 3rd party libraries like Scikit-learn and similar, which already contain this type of Model
	b. Avoid using 3rd party libraries which implement e.g. gradient descent, for optimizing the model
	c. You can use Numpy and similar, to operate on matrices.
2. Use the logistic regression model you built to predict the probability of default. The variables name is `DEFAULT_PAYMENT_NEXT_MONTH`. There is a dictionary that explains all the features included in the dataset called `dictionary.txt`.
3. Produce a report that summarizes your findings. Things to include in the report:
	a. Describe the features and the target included in the dataset. What insight did you gain from working with the data?
	b. Explain how you transformed the features, if at all
	c. The validation approach taken
	d. Which performance metrics did you use and why?
	f. What were the most important features?
	g. How useful is the model from a practical point of view? 
	h. What might you do differently if you had more time/resources?
4. This is not meant to be an exercise to develop a ‘final solution’ but more a first pass, to understand how you would approach this kind of exercise.
5. Submit the report and any source code (these may be part of the same document if you are working with a Jupyter notebook, etc.).
